==================
UDP Implementation
==================

Overview
--------
Our project utilizes the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) for communication between clients and servers. UDP is a connectionless protocol that operates at the transport layer of the OSI model. Unlike TCP, UDP does not provide reliability, ordering, or flow control mechanisms. However, it offers low overhead and is suitable for applications where speed and simplicity are more critical than reliability.


Functionality
-------------

Our UDP implementation consists of two main components:

1. UDP_Client.py:
    - Contains functions for the client-side implementation.
    - Detailed function descriptions, including parameters, return values, and examples, can be found inside this file.

2. UDP_Server.py:
    - Contains functions for the server-side implementation.
    - Detailed function descriptions, including parameters, return values, and examples, can be found inside this file

NOTE: UDP_Client.py and UDP_Server.py are in the UDP Branch and are not yet merged into main. 

TODO: Merge UDP into MAIN
